# Advent of Code 2024

This year I am using Go. I like the way [Advent of Code][aoc] lets me explore Go's APIs and paradigms.

Some of these would be more expressive in a functional language, and I miss that Go
does not have these kind of language features, like if-as-value. I might try introducing
some Map or Reduce-like behaviour, which I started doing [last year][fn].

## Notes

### Day 2

I feel part 2 could be less clunky / more elegant in terms of how I am removing the term for each check.

### Day 3

I am liking how Go does regexp capture groups. This solution was neat (and quick!) and I like how the code came out.
